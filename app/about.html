      <h3>So what is OS Bass Tabs?</h3>
      <p>OS Bass Tabs is a free, open source archive for bass tabs.</p>
      <p>A friend of mine showed me his bass guitar a few months ago, and I fell in love with it. Not long after (Christmas 2014) my dear ex surprised me with a beautiful ESP B10 electric bass guitar, and I started practicing like a mad man.</p>
      <p>I first used online bass tab archives such as <a href="http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/tabs/index_bass.htm" target="_blank">UltimateGuitar.com</a>, but at the same time I couldn't find some of my favourite songs online (and also there is too many annoying ads and way too long load times on those sites), so I started writing my own version of those tabs - using Markdown files of course (I am a geek at the end of the day.)</p>
      <p>I am very passionate about web development, and I wanted to see how quickly those markdown files can be turned into an easy to navigate static website, so I started working on OS Bass Tabs.</p>
      <p>OS Bass Tabs is all about `open source`. The code for the website is using the latest open source technologies you can get for building static HTML sites: Yeoman, Grunt, Bower and Jekyll (sorry if I am being far too technical here).</p>
      <p>The source code of the website can be found on <a href="https://github.com/robertpataki/os-bass-tabs" target="_blank">Github</a>, it is also hosted on Github in the form of Github Pages.</p>

      <h3>Who is OS Bass Tabs for?</h3>
      <p>This site started off as my primary bass practice tool. I started collecting the bass tabs of my favourite songs, but it is also for everyone, who want to learn those songs.</p>
      <p>The website was made open source, so that any geeky bassist can contribute to the list of songs, make improvements and add new features as they wish :)</p>

      <h3>Why is this website better than any other bass tabs sites?</h3>
      <p>It isn't better. It is just different:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>OS Bass Tabs is all about the user and the content. THERE IS NO ADS! I wanted a plaform for myself, which purely focuses on the enjoyment of playing the bass.</li>
        <li>The development's main focus has always been on the best UX you can get as a user, so there is no distraction (ads, bloating social sharing bollocks). It's just you and the real stuff.</li>
        <li>Anyone with a bit of front-end knowledge can contribute to the code over <a href="https://github.com/robertpataki/os-bass-tabs" target="_blank">Github</a>.</li>
        <li>New tabs can be added without registration - you need to be a Github geek, or email me and ask nicely to put your tabs on the site :)</li>
      </ul>
