      <h3>So what is OS Bass Tabs?</h3>
      <p><b>The concept is fairly simple:</b> OS Bass Tabs is a free, open source archive for bass guitar tabs.</p>
      <p>Unlike on any other bass tab website, each bass tab is here is accompanied by the song. The songs here come in the form of embedded Youtube videos: some of them  features the original song itself, while others feature brilliant bass covers!</p>

      <h3>Who is OS Bass Tabs for?</h3>
      <p>I started this project to better support my bass guitar practicing, but I've realised that it not only can help me, but probably others beginner bassists too.</p>
      <p>The website was made open source, so that any geeky bassists can contribute to the list of songs, make improvements to the website, and also add new features if they feel like.</p>

      <h3>Why is this website better than any other bass tabs sites?</h3>
      <p>The key differences are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The tab is created and maintained by the open source community</li>
        <li>Each tab is accompanied by the audio song, so that you can read the tabs and listen to the song itself while practicing</li>
        <li>There are no ads, no social media sharing bloat - no distraction, only you and the tabs</li>
        <li>Users of this site can leave comments on each tab page - making this place feel like there is a community behind it - and hopefully that will help us maintain a high quality of bass guitar tabs</li>
        <li>OS Bass Tabs is mobile and tablet friendly, you can practice on the go :)</li>
      </ul>
