      <h3>For the Clark Kent type</h3>
      <p>If you are familiar with <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">Github Pages</a>, the <a href="http://yeoman.io/" target="_blank">Yeoman</a> authoring environment, and the <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> blogging platform, then you will love this!</p>
      <p><b>Creating a new bass tab for OS Bass Tabs is as simple as:</b></p>

      <h3>For the Superman type</h3>
      <p>I understand that most bassists aren't that familiar with coding - and that's completely normal :).</p>
      <p>I want to keep this project as lean as possible, so at this stage I am not planning to build an online authoring tool for users - simply because it would take way too long compared to the gains. For that particular reason the website is completely static (meaning there is no server side magic involved) at the moment.</p>
      <p>If you would like to put your tabs to the site, the quickest way is to send me an email with your tabs, and I will make sure they will be added (giving you credit of course) to the site as soon as possible.</p>
      <p class="button_wrapper">
        <a href="mailto:osbasstabs@gmail.com?Subject=I have a bass tab for you!" class="button-big">Email me your tabs</a>

      <h3>Minimum requirements of a badass bass tab</h3>
      <p>There are a few things you have add to your tabs to make sure they really kick ass - here is a quick checklist for you:</p>
      
      <div class="highlight">
        <pre><code class="text language-text">
artist:       "The artist/band name of the song"
song:         "The title of the song"
album:        "The name of the album"
year:         "The year the song was released"
author:       "Your name"
author_email: "Your email address" (optional)
author_site:  "Your website" (optional)
tuning:       "GDAE"
youtube:      "Full URL of the Youtube video for the song"
        </code></pre>
      </div>

      <p>Once you have all the above details and your killer bass tabs, you're good to go! You can have a quick look at existing tabs to see how these details are used to build up a <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/">superhero bass guitar tab</a> on this site.</p>

      <p>With regards of the technical side of the tabs, I have been following the practices defined in <a href="http://www.basstabarchive.com/howto.html" target="_blank">this document</a>.</p>

      <h3>A bit about copyright</h3>
      <p>I would love this project to be a real community driven one, so whatever we do is all for the comminity, and done by the community. This includes bassists wanting to learn and share their tabs, just as well as the developers who want to participate.</p>
