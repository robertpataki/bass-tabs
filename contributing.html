You can have a quick look at existing tabs to see how these details are used to build up a <a href="/os-bass-tabs/">superhero bass guitar tab</a> on this site.</p> <p>With regards of the technical side of the tabs, I have been following the practices defined in <a href=http://www.basstabarchive.com/howto.html target=_blank>this document</a>.</p> </div> </div> <div class=l-block-page> <div class=content> <h3>A bit about copyright</h3> <p>I would love this project to be a real community driven one, so whatever we do is all for the comminity, and done by the community.
